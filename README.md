## Teachers

- Szymon M. Kie≈Çbasa [[LUMC/BDS](https://www.lumc.nl/over-het-lumc/afdelingen/biomedical-data-sciences/)], coordinator, `smkielbasa@lumc.nl`
- Ramin Monajemi [[LUMC/BDS](https://www.lumc.nl/over-het-lumc/afdelingen/biomedical-data-sciences/)]
- Mo Arkani [[LUMC/BDS](https://www.lumc.nl/over-het-lumc/afdelingen/biomedical-data-sciences/)]

## Overview

The course offers a practical introduction to a few programming languages and tools currently used in data science:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/) is a general-purpose, high-level and easy to learn programming language. It provides a large number of 
data science libraries (e.g. machine learning, neural networks, data manipulation, data visualization).
- [SQL](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/) is a standard language used to create, query, update and manage relational databases. For example, such 
databases are used to store large tables with results of experiments.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a tool that allows to track changes in files during development of programs. It is the current standard 
for collaborative code development.

During the course the students will write Python programs of growing complexity (from basic coding examples to fitting 
a machine learning model). After this course you will be able to program simple reproducible data analyses 
(consisting of data reading, cleaning, simple modelling, and reporting steps). The state-of-the-art Python-specific 
data manipulation/visualization ([pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)) and data science libraries will be discussed.  
Fundamentals of the relational databases and of the SQL language will be presented in a context of an example 
database ([SQLite](https://sqlite.org/index.html)). The database will be accessed through direct SQL statements and through high-level 
object-oriented Python library ([SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/)).

First, you will work alone and practice code development. Later, shared code development will be practiced 
in groups. The students will be requested to use [git](https://git-scm.com/) to track changes in their code and to share their code with 
other students through [GitHub](https://github.com/).

Finally, the relevance of data stewardship and [FAIR principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FAIR_data) (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) 
will be discussed.

## Grading

- Components of the final grade:
  - **Assignments A, B, C (each of weight 1; total weight 3)**:
    - Assignments A, B and C are separately graded.
    - The grade range is 1-10 but when the primary deadline is not met then the maximum grade is 8.
    - To pass the course, the Assignments A, B, C rounded mean grade must be greater than 5.5.
    - The Assignments A, B, C rounded mean grade has weight=3 in the final grade.
  - **Group Assignment (weight 3)**:
    - The grade range is 1-10.
    - To pass the course, the group assignment rounded grade must be greater than 5.5.
    - The group assignment rounded grade has weight=3 in the final grade.
  - **Data stewardship quiz**:
    - To pass the course, the quiz needs to be solved with the PASS result.
    - The quiz grade is not part of the final grade formula.
  - **Exam/Retake (weight 4)**:
    - The grade range is 1-10.
    - To pass the course, the exam/retake grade must be greater than 5.5.
    - The exam/retake grade has weight=4 in the final grade.
    - The exam will cover the course objectives marked with :writing_hand:.
    - The exam will not cover the course objectives marked with :no_entry_sign: - these objectives are evaluated in the group assignment and the quiz.
- Final grade:
    - The final grade is calculated as a weighted mean of the component grades.
    - The final grade is rounded to the nearest half integer.
    - To pass the course, the final grade needs to be greater or equal 6.0.
