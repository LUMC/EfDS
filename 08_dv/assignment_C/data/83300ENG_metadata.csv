2. DEFINITIONS AND EXPLANATION OF SYMBOLS

Definitions:

Air emissions
Emissions of pollutants into the air.

Emission factor
Emission per unit of activity, e.g. per kilometre travelled, per vehicle kilometre or per kilogram of fuel used.

Stationary sources
Installations bound to a single location or other fixed point sources. Included are stationary installations for generating heat and / or electricity, industrial processing facilities, waste incineration installations and storage, transhipment and other handling activities that cause emissions. Emissions from stationary sources include those emissions not caused by mobile emission sources. 

Mobile sources
Specific sources of emissions, such as the vehicles used for the carriage of goods, passenger transport and the mobile equipment and machinery. The main contribution of emissions from mobile sources stem from the combustion of motor fuels. In addition emissions stem from the wear of tires, brakes and road surfaces and moreover the evaporation of fuel is accounted for. Emissions from mobile sources that stem from international road, air and sea transport by Dutch residents is also accounted for.

Standard Industrial Classification 2008 (SIC 2008):
The Dutch hierarchic classification of economic activities is used by Statistics Netherlands to classify private sector entities by main activity. The SIC 2008 is the version used since 2008.

'Sector of industry' or 'branch' is the common term used to define businesses sharing the same main activity. 
Statistics Netherlands uses the classification by main activity, the so-called Standard Industrial Classification (SIC). Businesses in a sector of industry or branch may also be engaged in other activities (subsidiary activities).

The SIC 2008 includes various levels indicated by a maximum of five digits. The four-digits level corresponds to the classification employed by the European Union (NACE). The first two digits correspond to the United Nations classification (ISIC).

4. SOURCES AND METHODS

The air emission accounts determine and present the emissions of harmful substances caused by Dutch economic activity. Air emission accounts are consistent with the national accounts. As a result, the figures do deviate from the figures in the pollutant release and transfer register (PRTR), the National Environmental Balance and from recording and porting to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) on greenhouse gas emissions. These publications are based on the emissions caused at the Dutch territory. In contrast however, air emissions accounts show, like the national accounts do, the emissions caused from activities by Dutch residents. This means that emissions by residents abroad are included and pollution by non-residents in the Netherlands is excluded in the compilation of the air emissions accounts. 

In air emissions accounts, the emissions of the different substances and their contribution to specific environmental problems (environmental themes) are included. The emission of these substances are allocated to the various economic activities. Emissions from natural sources, such as methane released by peat soils or carbon dioxide released during the decomposition of organic material in nature conservation areas, are excluded. 

Emissions from stationary sources are allocated to the industries using the emission inventory data. Emissions from mobile sources are allocated to the various industries by using auxiliary data like transport statistics and fuel use and its distribution over the different industries. As a result a detailed emission table is composed. The environmental issues distinguished are the greenhouse effect, ozone depletion and acidification.

Figures from the <a href=/""/https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=AEA/""/>OECD</a> have been used for CO2 emissions from aviation These data have been calculated in accordance with the guidelines of the air emissions accounts.
